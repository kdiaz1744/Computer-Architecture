# Computer-Architecture
The final project of this class involved simulating an address cache using Assembly

The way that all the programs run is that it first will ask the user for the cache size (which has to be divisible by 2, or it will exit the program), then it asks the user for the adress sequence that it wishes to test with, and when the sequencing is finished, simply enter -1 to show results and exit.
